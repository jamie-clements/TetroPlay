# TetroPlay

## Overview
TetroPlay is a Tetris-inspired game developed in Java. Built with a focus on clean object-oriented design, it showcases fundamental game mechanics like piece rotation, movement, and line clearing, all presented through a user-friendly graphical interface powered by Swing. Whether you're looking to play a quick game or explore the source code, this project has something for everyone.

## Features
- **Core Gameplay**: Move, rotate, and drop Tetrominoes to clear lines and score points.
- **Interactive Menu**: Start a new game or exit from a sleek, responsive main menu.
- **Score Tracking**: Keep track of your performance with an in-game score counter.
- **Keyboard Controls**:
